# Data Science

In this folder you could find and inspect all the Data Science work related performed by Neutrino Solutions.

Data science folder contains: Machine Learning / Deep Learning Models development Notebooks, All Models and Scales saved for further use, and Notebooks for a workflow of predictions.

Here is a description of each content of the directory:

1. CA02 Model: All contents and Notebooks related to the CA02 Model (PROTOTYPE: This model is a further step in the project, is not included in Outputs)
2. CA10 Model: All contents and Notebooks related to the CA10 Model (PROTOTYPE: This model is a further step in the project, is not included in Outputs)
3. MODELS THAT NEED IMPROVMENT: All contents and Notebooks related to the  Models from some specific ports, but the results where poor, they need a improvement (PROTOTYPE: This model is a further step in the project, is not included in Outputs)
4. MODELS THAT NEED IMPROVMENT: All contents and Notebooks related to the  Models from some specific ports, but the results where poor, they need a improvement (PROTOTYPE: This model is a further step in the project, is not included in Outputs)
5. TransAtlanticModel: All contents and Notebooks related to the Trans Atlantinc Route (Model in Production)
6. TransPacificModel: All contents and Notebooks related to the Trans Pacific Route (Model in Production)
7. CA02 Predictions: All contents and Notebooks related to the Trans Pacific Route (Model in Production)
8. Predictions TransAtlantic Route: Notebook that generates daily prediction for the trans atlantic model (Functional Workflow)
