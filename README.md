# Early Detection System for Transnational Maritime Enterprises - EDSTME

This repository contains all of the code related to the development of our project for the Factored Datathon 2024. 
We created a complete end-to-end solution that utilizes raw GDELT data (Events 1.0 and GKG 1.0) and produces valuable insights for any maritime logistics company. 

The repo structure separates our code in three main components: 
- Data analytics
- Data engineering
- Data science

## Data analytics
Contains all the exploratory work related to the GDELT datasets. We properly documented each step on our quest to uncover how to extract insights that actually provide business value. 

## Data engineering
Contains all the testing and production work we performed. Includes the code for our production pipelines deployed on Databricks Workflows

## Data science 
Contains all the models and full explanation related to the models we deployed.

In each folder, you will find more readme files documenting each part of the project.
